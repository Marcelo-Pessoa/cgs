The Bauhaus is a German artistic movement which lasted from 1919-1933. Its goal was to merge all artistic mediums into one unified approach, that of combining an individual’s artistry with mass production and function. Bauhaus design is often abstract, angular, and geometric, with little ornamentation. 

“Bauhaus” literally translates to “house of building,” which was derived by inverting the German word Hausbau, or “building of a house.”
