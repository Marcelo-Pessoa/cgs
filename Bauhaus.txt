The Bauhaus is a German artistic movement which lasted from 1919-1933. Its goal was to merge all artistic mediums into one unified approach, that of combining an individualâ€™s artistry with mass production and function. Bauhaus design is often abstract, angular, and geometric, with little ornamentation.
